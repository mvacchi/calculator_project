# Calculator

A fully functional on-screen calculator built with HTML, CSS Grid, and vanilla JavaScript as part of **The Odin Project – Foundations**.

This project focuses on state management, event handling, and building calculator logic from scratch (no `eval()`), while handling real-world edge cases and user interactions.
